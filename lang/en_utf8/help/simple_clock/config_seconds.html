<h1>Show seconds with each clock</h1>

<p>Showing seconds will show users the time including seconds on all clocks visible.</p>

<p style="background:yellow;border:3px dashed black;padding:10px;"><strong>Warning</strong><br />
The initial time shown is the time when the page was created.
When this page content arrives at the user's browser, the time difference will include this delay
(usually a few seconds). This is often acceptable as any interaction with Moodle will
involve a delay, but the delay will be more evident with seconds shown.</p>
